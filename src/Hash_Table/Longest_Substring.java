 3. Given a string, find the length of the longest substring .

 Examples:
 Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.
 Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.without repeating characters
 Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
